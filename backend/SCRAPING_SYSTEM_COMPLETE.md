## üöÄ Production Deployment

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@host:port/db
DATABASE_URL_SYNC=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db

# Redis for Celery
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0

# API Keys (optional for enhanced functionality)

```bash
# Test individual scraper
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/admin/scraping/test/visitsingapore" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Run full scraping
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/admin/scraping/run-sync" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"
```
